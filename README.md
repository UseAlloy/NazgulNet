The one API to rule them all

![https://critiqueen5.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/frodo.jpg](https://critiqueen5.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/frodo.jpg)

## How to run this

1. Install Node and NPM
2. `npm install` in the project root
3. `npm start` to start the server

Note: you may need API keys to run other people's APIs locally, get them from the maintainer if you're interested

## What you should do

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new file under `contributors` with your name
3. Add an endpoint that does whatever you think is cool or interesting
4. Make sure to follow good API practices (validation, proper HTTP codes, error handling, etc.)
5. Submit a pull request to this repo to merge your fork.
6. Let us know via email and we'll do a code review with our engineers!

Hopefully this is easier for you and more indicative of skill/ engineering zeal than doing a whiteboarding interview.
